6. Compiling CloudSim: using Ant
--------------------------------

This release contains a simple buildfile for compiling CloudSim classes.
You need to have ant installed (http://ant.apache.org/).
Ant can be used in both Windows and Unix/Linux environment.

Usage:

  * Being in the CloudSim root directory (cloudsim/), type 'ant' to compile all 
    cloudsim source files, put them into the classes/ directory and to create 
    a cloudsim-new.jar file in the jars/ directory

  * Being in the CloudSim root directory (cloudsim/), type 'ant clean' to delete 
    all the compiled classes and the classes/ directory itself. The generated 
    cloudsim-new.jar is not deleted.

Note:

  * You need to set up PATH for ant in Windows and/or Unix.
